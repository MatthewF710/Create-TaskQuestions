### Pre-FRQ Practice

## Identify the Algorithm present in the JavaScript Files.

### Aspects of Algorithm

Sequencing
Selection
Iteration

### Question 1

Programs accept input to achieve their intended functionality. **Describe at least one valid input to your program and what your program does with that input.**

- Write your responses to this question only on the designated pages in the separate Written Response booklet.
- If there are multiple parts to this question, write the part letter with your response.

Angelina:

```Javascript
function insertText(inputContent, type) {
  DOMSelect.results.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", `<br></br>`);
  const content = inputContent;
  if (type === "file") { //selection, if the type is a file
    content.forEach(function (item) { //iteration, going through each item
      DOMSelect.results.insertAdjacentHTML(
        "beforeend",
        `<p class="text">${item}</p>`
      );
    });
  } else {
    content.forEach(function (item) {
      DOMSelect.results.insertAdjacentHTML(
        "beforeend",
        `<p class="text">${item.textContent}</p>`
      );
    });
    DOMSelect.input.innerHTML = "";
  }
  DOMSelect.inputbox.style.display = "none";
  DOMSelect.settings.style.display = ""; //sequencing, going through list of steps
}
```

```
1. The input of this function is inputContent. A valid input would be any file, for example, a text input. This first checks if its a file, then goes through each item and inserts it into the html directly. If its not a file, which doesn't apply, it specifically takes the text content inside of the file.

```

Butter:

```Javascript
const resetHistory = function () {
  DOMSelectors.mainOutput.innerHTML = ""; // Clear previous quote
  if (quoteCurrent.length > 0) {
    for (let i = 0; i < quoteCurrent.length; i++) {
      const quote = quoteCurrent[i];
      createQuoteCard(quote);
    }
  }
};

```

```
1. The function has no input but it uses the global array quoteCurrent, filtering through for if the length is greater than 1, and if it is for each one it will create a quote card.
```

### Question 2

Refer to your Personalized Project Reference when answering this question.

#### Part (a):

Consider the first iteration statement included in the Procedure section of your Personalized Project Reference. **Describe what is being accomplished by the code in the body of the iteration statement.**
Angelina:

```

```

Butter:

```

```

#### Part (b):

Consider the procedure identified in part (i) of the Procedure section of your Personalized Project Reference.

- Write two calls to your procedure that each cause a different code segment in the procedure to execute.
- Describe the expected behavior of each call. If it is not possible for two calls to your procedure to cause different code segments to execute, explain why this is the case for your procedure.
  Angelina:

```

```

Butter:

```

```

#### Part (c):

Suppose another programmer provides you with a procedure called `checkValidity(value)` that:

- Returns `true` if a value passed as an argument is considered valid by the other programmer.
- Returns `false` otherwise.

Using the list identified in the List section of your Personalized Project Reference, **explain in detailed steps an algorithm that uses `checkValidity` to check whether all elements in your list are considered valid by the other programmer.** Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to write the program code for the algorithm that uses `checkValidity`.

- Write your responses to this question only on the designated pages in the separate Written Response booklet.
- If there are multiple parts to this question, write the part letter with your response.
